SED Fitting
===========

Typically you will want to use the derived Fermi spectrum to fit
a SED model taking measurements at other energies into account,
e.g. radio, X-ray or TeV gamma-ray.

TODO: Make an example on how to do a chi2 and a likelihood fit
to some source (Crab, AGN?) using an SSC model.
