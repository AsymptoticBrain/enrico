=====================

Any improvements to Enrico are welcome!

Please report bugs and contribute features using github.

To be implemented and tested
----------------------------

Here is a list of things that need to be done.

* Access 2FGL and plot lightcurve / spectra with 
  flux points / upper limits / butterflies
* Binned spectrum
* Binned flux points
* Binned light curve
* Binned TS map
* Unbinned spectrum
* Unbinned flux points
* Unbinned light curve
* Unbinned TS map
* Commmand line tools to make xml files
* Nice analysis result summary web page
* MPIK job submission
* MPIK find data & diffuse emission & catalog files automatically
* Simultaneous Fermi - HESS spectral fit
* Write documentation -> tutorial
* Move repo to github and put sphinx docu there
* Model the 12 ExtendedSources (extension 4 in the catalog) correctly.
* Include methods to fit Gaussian sources (i.e. make and use FITS template)

Open Issues
-----------

* I'm not sure what the best way is to include data files in
  the python package.
  Maybe use this solution instead, which has the advantage
  that the package doesn't have to be installed?
