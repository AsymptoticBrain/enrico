Developer Information
=====================

Any improvements to Enrico are welcome!

Please report bugs and contribute features using github.

Or even better (for us :-), fork us on github, make the improvement yourself and
make a pull request for your change to be included in the main repo.

If you don't know how to use git and github, check out
