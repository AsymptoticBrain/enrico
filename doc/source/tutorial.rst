Tutorial
========

This tutorial will walk you through the steps to repeat the analysis
of the AGN TODO done in the official Fermi collaboration python tutorial
and results published here.

We strongly recommend that you run this analysis once, so that you
can be sure to produce correct results before analyzing your source.

First run this check to make sure your setup is ok:

.. code-block:: bash

Enrico will tell you if you forgot something, in which case have a
look at :ref:`setup`.
